A scatterplot between non-penalty expected Goals(npxG) created per 90 min and non-penalty expected Goals per shot created in python.
Analysis is done with Premier Leauge and Laliga 2021-2022 season data. Premier leauge clubs are represented by red and Laliga clubs by purple.

This provides insight into a club performance. xG per 90 measures number of goals a team is expected to score per 90, while the xG/shot measures the probability of a shot resulting in a goal. A positive corelation between the two metrices would indicate that the team is taking high-quality shot and convert them into goals at high rate.
